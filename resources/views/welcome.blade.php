            <h3>Hi! Welcome to the HBO-ICT website of Ruben!</h3>
            <p>The reason why the HZ ICT programme suits me is because I've been interested in computers since a very young age and it still is a topic I am super interested in. It doesn't matter if it's internals like CPUs and motherboards, software or programming, I personally find all of it really interesting. The way everything works together like magic has never failed to captivate me. All this naturally led me to the ICT study at HZ.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I wanted to push myself beyond just programming and hardware knowledge. I see ICT as a field that offers much more than just that, for example networking, cybersecurity and even project management. Expanding my knowledge about those new topics allows me to challenge myself in new ways and gain a more well-rounded understanding of the ICT field.</p>
